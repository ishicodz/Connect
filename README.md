## Connect

A multiplayer turn-based strategy game with a vibrant neon theme where players compete to dominate the board with their color by strategically placing the balls.

## Game Mechanics

- Players (2-5) take turns to place colored balls on a 6x6 grid
- Each player is assigned a different color (blue, pink, green, yellow, or purple)
- When a player taps an empty grid cell, a ball of their color appears
- Tapping a cell with one ball adds another ball (2 total)
- Tapping a cell with two balls adds a third ball (3 total)
- Tapping a cell with three balls adds a fourth ball and causes an explosion - the balls spread to adjacent cells (up, down, left, right)
- When balls move to a cell containing another player's ball(s), they convert those balls to the current player's color
- The game ends when only one color remains on the board - that player wins!

## Features

- Vibrant neon-themed UI with glowing elements
- Support for 2-5 players on the same device

## How to Play

1. Select the number of players (2-5)
2. Enter names for each player
3. Click "Start Game" to begin
4. Players take turns clicking on cells to place or add balls
5. Try to strategically place balls to create chains of explosions
6. The last player with balls remaining on the board wins!

## Game Strategy Tips

- Focus on creating clusters of 3 balls to trigger explosions
- Try to position your balls near opponent's cells to convert them when exploding
- Pay attention to the chain reactions as they can quickly change the board state
- In multiplayer games, be cautious of getting caught between two players who might target you
- Corner positions can be strategic as they only have two adjacent cells
